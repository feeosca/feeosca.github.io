<p data-brackets-id="404">What do I do?!!!!? <br data-brackets-id="405">
 Why do they teach us IT anyway? Sure, sometimes it's fun - right now. I think i'm doing a blog. I wonder if I can do that for a website. Possibly <br data-brackets-id="406"> meh. I can't be bothered to ask because im slightly enjoying this. <br data-brackets-id="407">  <br data-brackets-id="408"> <strong data-brackets-id="409"> Mr Heggarty, if you see this, im pretty sure i'm doing the right thing right now. You're allowed to do any website you want, right? I'm starting a blog ;) </strong> After that i'm gonna post it on something. If i can find out how to do that in the first place. Oh, and authorities, if there are rules against a 11 year old doing a blog, im 22 and live in South Dakota, own no guns and have hijacked a porsche once. That was my only crime. Oh, apart from being in possession of weed. But that's not a crime- I thought it was legal now- but nooooo... instead they chuck me in a cell. Luckily I had some C4 suffed in my back pocket. I travelled to space when I was 15 and worked for the Gestapo as a H.Y.D.R.A agent. Heil Hitler! For my science project I made a nuclear reactor and it blew up. I helped the American scientists create the Nuclear Bomb and I got a million dollars and a visa. That is basically my story with a few tinsy winsy bits added in. <br data-brackets-id="410"> So, how can I make this blog interesting? If anyone has any ideas please tell me.  <br data-brackets-id="411"> Hey I know! I could review food, which basically just consists of putting in delicious pictures of pizza.
